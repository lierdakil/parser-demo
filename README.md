# parsers demo

This is a teaching aid to show how LL(1), LR, SLR and LALR parsers operate based on push-down automata principles.

This is not intended to be complete, useful for any particular application, or show some particularly good code. However, GUI portions may be interesting as a (contrived) example of using webkitgtk in Haskell (see `app/Main.hs`)

Parser building code is in `src/`. It is intended to be readable, not efficient.
